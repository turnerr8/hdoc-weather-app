_How about building a weather application that fetches real-time weather data from an API (such as OpenWeatherMap API) based on user input (e.g., city name or zip code) and displays the current weather conditions along with a short forecast for the next few days? This project can involve using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface and make API calls to retrieve weather data. You can also include features like dynamic background images based on the weather condition, temperature unit conversion (Celsius to Fahrenheit), and error handling for invalid inputs._

Today i will make a weather app that you can search a location and get the weather along with an icon for it.
